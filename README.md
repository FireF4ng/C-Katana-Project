## Object of the Game
Players are divided into three (secret) teams:
- The Shogun and Samurai team (the number of Samurai depends on the number of players)
- The Ninjas (2 or 3 according to the number of players)
- The Ronin, who always plays for himself.
For each team, the aim of the game is to gather the most Honor Points or to have the last man standing.

## The Characters
Your character has a unique special ability. Each character also has a Health value, which tells you how many wounds you may suffer before being “Defeated”.

### Harmless Characters
You are considered “Harmless” in either of these situations:
- You have no Health Points; or
- You have no cards in your hand.
If you are Harmless:
- You cannot be the target of Weapon cards;
- You are unaffected by the Action cards Battle Cry and Jujutsu;
- You are not counted when determining the Difficulty of an attack.

## The Game
The game is played in turns in clockwise order. The Shogun begins. Your turn is split into 4 phases, which you must play in order:
1. Recover
2. Draw
3. Play
4. Discard

## Attack Difficulty
In order to target another character with a Weapon card, you must first check the Difficulty. The Difficulty to attack a character is equal to the minimum number of places between the two characters, clockwise or counterclockwise.

## Weapons and Parries
The main way to deal wounds to other characters is to attack them by playing a Weapon card. Each Weapon card shows two numbers: The top number shows the maximum Difficulty you may attack with that card; the lower number shows how many wounds that Weapon will deal if it hits.

## Defeating a Player
If you lose your last Health Point, you are “Defeated”! You must give one of your Honor Points to the player who Defeated you.

## End of the Game
At any time, if one or more players have no Honor Points left, the game ends immediately. All players now reveal their Role cards and add up their score.

### Victory of the Swordmaster
If at any time there is only one player with any Health Points, the game ends immediately, and that player’s team wins the game.

## Special Rules for 3 Players
One player is randomly dealt the Shogun card. The other two players are Ninjas. The Shogun begins with 6 Honor Points, and each Ninja starts with 3 Honor Points. The game is played as normal with some exceptions.

## Other Cards

### The Golden Rule
Whenever a card contradicts the rules, the card takes precedence!

### Battle Cry
Each of the other players chooses to play a parry or suffer 1 wound. Harmless players are not affected by the Battle Cry.

### Breathing
You regain all your lost Health Points (i.e., you heal all of your wounds). Then, 1 other player of your choice (not you!) draws 1 card from the deck. You cannot heal other players. Breathing can be played even if you have all of your Health Points.

### Bushido
Play this card in front of any player, regardless of Difficulty and even if he is Harmless. If Bushido is in front of you at the end of your Recover Phase, you must flip over and discard the top card in the deck. The effect of Bushido depends on the card you turn over:
- If it is a Weapon: you must either discard a Weapon card from your hand or discard 1 Honor Point (to the box). If you discard a Weapon, Bushido is passed to the player on your left (who must make the same check on his turn). If you instead lose 1 Honor Point, Bushido is discarded.
- If it is not a Weapon: Bushido is passed to the player on your left, who must make the same check on his turn (and so on).
In both cases, your turn is then played as normal. Only 1 Bushido in play is allowed: you cannot play Bushido if another Bushido card is already in play.

### Daimyo
You may play this card to draw 2 cards from the deck. However, if this card is in your hand at the end of the game it is worth 1 Honor Point. Daimyo Honor points are never doubled or tripled. Daimyo cards in the Ronin’s hand are worth 0 Honor Points.

### Diversion
Draw 1 random card from the hand of any other player (regardless of Difficulty) and add it to your hand.

### Fast Draw
When you hit another character with a Weapon card, you deal 1 additional wound for each Fast Draw you have in play.

### Focus
On your turn, you may play 1 additional Weapon card for each Focus you have in play.

### Geisha
Force 1 player to discard 1 card (regardless of Difficulty). You may choose any Property card in play, or one drawn randomly from the player’s hand.

### Jujutsu
Each of the other players chooses to play 1 Weapon card or suffer 1 wound. Harmless players are not affected by the Jujutsu.

### Tea Ceremony
Draw 3 cards from the deck. Each of the other players draws 1 card from the deck.

## The Characters (Health Points)
Unless your Character card says otherwise, you may use your abilities as many times as you wish (if possible).

### Benkei (5)
All other players have +1 Difficulty when they attack you.

### Chiyome (4)
You can only be wounded by Weapon cards. You are not affected by Jujutsu and Battle Cry cards. You are affected normally by other Action cards, such as Tea Ceremony.

### Goemon (5)
You may play 1 additional Weapon card during your turn. So, if you have 1 Focus in play, you may play up to 3 Weapon cards each turn.

### Ginchiyo (4)
You take 1 wound less than normal when attacked by any Weapon, to a minimum of 1 wound.

### Hanzō (4)
You may play a Weapon card from your hand as a parry, unless it is the only card in your hand. You may use this ability even in response to cards such as Battle Cry.

### Hideyoshi (4)
You draw 1 card more than normal during the Draw Phase of your turn.

### Ieyasu (5)
During your Draw Phase, you may take the top card of the discard pile as your first draw. Any other cards you draw must come from the draw deck.

### Kojirō (5)
Your Weapons can hit any Difficulty, regardless of the value on your Weapon card.

### Musashi (5)
If you successfully attack another character with a Weapon card, you inflict 1 additional wound. This does not apply to cards that are not Weapons, like Jujutsu.

### Nobunaga (5)
During your Play Phase, you may discard 1 Resilience Point to draw 1 card from the deck. You may not use your last Resilience Point in this way.

### Tomoe (5)
Each time you successfully attack another character with a Weapon card, you draw 1 card from the deck. You only draw 1 card, even if your Weapon does more than 1 wound.

### Ushiwaka (4)
Each time you suffer a wound from a Weapon card, you draw 1 card from the deck (so 3 wounds = 3 cards).
